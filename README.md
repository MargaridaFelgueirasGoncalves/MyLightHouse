LightHouse App

//The Introduction
This project was developed for our Hackathon, during our bootcamp. This 24 hour project is the result of the culmination of everything that was learned during the bootcamp. We had to develope an idea, execute it and present it to our fellow Code Cadets, Master Coders and IT Companies.


//The Idea
At the beginning of the Hackathon, our Master Coders gave us a theme "Farewell" and a song "Bye Bye Bye" by NSYNC to use as "inspiration" for our app.
Domestic violence is a difficult crime to report and sometimes information reaches institutions too late. We realized that, according to the APAV data, that only 17.7% of the victims made the complaint, from the Web. As society evolves, reporting crimes and monitoring victims from an app is an emerging need that must be met.
With all this information, we decided to create the LightHouse application. It is an application dedicated to protecting and accompanying victims of domestic violence. 

//The Development
Our team is made up of 5 great minds. HÃ©lio, a Front-End Development master, Margarida, canny, dedicated and motivating, JN, a well of vitality and work capacity, Gaio, a selfmade man, with a critical spirit and attentive to detail and Emanuel, imaginative and creative.
These 5 fantastic, in constant communication and teamwork, were winning each stage until reaching the MVP. Once the MVP was reached, we realized that we could go further, implementing features that were not initially in the plan. We built a database for victims, lawyers and psychologists. A Panic Button disguised in an extension for Chrome, for emergency situations and a Front-End, for victims or whistleblowers to be able to send information about cases of domestic violence.
